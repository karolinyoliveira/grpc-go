# gRPC - Go

## Requirements

## Usage

First, start the server with the following command:

```
 go run cmd/server/server.go
```

And then run the client script:

```
 go run cmd/client/client.go
```

You can still use evans as a client for calling all procedures allowed by this server.

```
./evans -r -p 5051
```
